# Cybersecurity Automation System

This project implements DevOps principles to automate cybersecurity tasks, utilizing containerization, networking, and Linux. The project consists of the following components:

- A Dockerfile that defines a custom image with the necessary tools and dependencies for the cybersecurity tasks.
- A Kubernetes deployment manifest that specifies the configuration and resources for running the cybersecurity tasks as pods in a cluster.
- An Ansible playbook that performs additional setup and configuration for the cybersecurity tasks, such as installing packages, creating users, and setting permissions.
- A Linux hardening script that applies best practices and recommendations for enhancing system security, such as disabling unnecessary services, enforcing password policies, and configuring firewall rules.
- A Python script that automates the execution of the cybersecurity tasks using the subprocess module and object-oriented programming.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you need to have the following installed on your system:

- Docker
- Kubernetes
- Minikube (optional)

## Usage

To run this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```git clone https://github.com/VEEXH/Cybersecurity-Automation-System.git```
2. Build the custom image from the Dockerfile using the following command:
   ```docker build -t cybersecurity-automation```
3. Create a Kubernetes cluster using Minikube (or any other tool) using the following command:
   ```minikube start```
4. Deploy the cybersecurity-automation pods to the cluster using the following command:
   ```kubectl apply -f deployment.yml```
5. Check the status of the pods using the following command:
   ```kubectl get pods```
6. Wait until all the pods are running and then check the logs of each pod using the following command:
   ```kubectl logs <pod-name>```
7. You should see the output of each cybersecurity task in the logs, as well as the files generated by each task in the /home directory of each pod.
